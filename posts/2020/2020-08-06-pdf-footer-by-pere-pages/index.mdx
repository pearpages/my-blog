# How-to "Footers" in HTML Print

> flying-saucer-pdf

* put the **footer** html at the beginning of the content if you want it to be in every page.
* Use **tables** when you have to be very strict about layout

```css
footer {
  position: running(footer-element);
}

@page {
  size: A4 portrait;
  margin-top:1.1cm;
  margin-left:1.7cm;
  margin-right:1.7cm;
  margin-bottom:3.3cm; // this is the space you'll be able to use in the footer
  @top-right {
    content: element(top-element);
  }
  @bottom-left {
    content: element(footer-element);
  } 
}
```

```html
<body>
  <footer>
    <!-- if you put the footer before the content it will be able to place it in every @page @bottom-left; otherwise it will be from where it finds it. -->
    <hr/> <hr/>
