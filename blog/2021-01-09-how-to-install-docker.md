## Install Docker on macOS

**Docker Desktop** for Mac OS Sierra 10.13 and above can be downloaded from **Docker Hub**. The package includes the Docker server, CLI, Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes.

Two editions are available: **stable** and **edge** with experimental features. The stable version is best for most developers.

Double-click ```Docker.dmg``` to open the installer.
