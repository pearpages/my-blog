The espresso machine I want to try.

> The Signature Series of the Flair Espresso Maker is a step up from the Classic in terms of styling, beauty, and aesthetics. Featuring either a brushed chrome, a matte black or our new white finish and our Signature copper-plated portafilter base, any Flair Signature will be the centerpiece of your kitchen or coffee station. Each Signature comes ready with a stainless steel screen, our Bottomless 2-in-1 Portafilter, and our custome pressure gauge, to produce the very best in espresso.
