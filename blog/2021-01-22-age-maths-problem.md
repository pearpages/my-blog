- **x**: My current age
- **y**: Your current age
- **z**: Years between you and me

I am three times older than the age you had when I had your current age.

```
x = 3 (y-z)
```

When you will be my current age both will be 77 years old

```
(x+z) + (y+z) = 77
```

I am your age plus the difference between us (because I am older)

```
x = y + z
```

## Solution

```
x = 33
y = 22
z = 11
```
